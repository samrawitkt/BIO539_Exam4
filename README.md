## Instruction steps

This repository represnts the steps followed to write the linguistic complexity of the string(sequence).

**1 step,** Create a function that calculates observed k-mers (unique k_mers) taking read(string) and K(int) values as an argument.\
**2 step,** Create a function calculates all the possible k-mers also taking read and K values as an argument.\
**3 step,** Create a data frame function with index, observed k-mers and possible k-mers columns.\
**4 step,** Create a function that calculates linguistic complexity taking dataframe as an argument.\
**5 step,** Create a main function that reads any string given by user and calculates the lingustic complexity.\
**6 step,** Create separate python test script to test the written python script.\

**Note:** each of the functions run and give the right output. However, test script gives me error message that I could't able to complete test.
