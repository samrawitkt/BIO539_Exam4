## Instruction steps

This repository represents the steps followed to write the linguistic complexity of the string(sequence).

**1 step,** Created a function that calculates observed k-mers (unique k_mers) taking read(string) and K(int) values as an argument.\
**2 step,** Created a function calculates all the possible k-mers also taking read and K values as an argument.\
**3 step,** Created a data frame function with index, observed k-mers and possible k-mers columns.\
**4 step,** Created a function that calculates linguistic complexity taking dataframe as an argument.\
**5 step,** Created a main function that reads any string given by user and calculates the lingustic complexity.\
**6 step,** Created separate python test script to test the written python script.\

**Note** string.csv is an excel file with some sequence examples.
