## Instruction steps

This repository represents the steps followed to write the linguistic complexity of the string(sequence).

**1 step,** Create a function that calculates observed k-mers (unique k_mers) taking read(string) and K(int) values as an argument.\
**2 step,** Create a function calculates all the possible k-mers also taking read and K values as an argument.\
**3 step,** Create a data frame function with index, observed k-mers and possible k-mers columns.\
**4 step,** Create a function that calculates linguistic complexity taking dataframe as an argument.\
**5 step,** Create a main function that reads any string given by user and calculates the lingustic complexity.\
**6 step,** Create separate python test script to test the written python script.\

**Note:** each of the functions run and give the right output in python when tested separately as well as in the script when run on the command line. However, test script gives me 
error message "name not found"...'function names' not defined, that I was not able to resolve.
